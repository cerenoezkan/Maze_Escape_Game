# ðŸŒ€ Maze Escape Game

This project is a **Maze Escape Game** designed using the **Stack data structure** in C++.  
The game utilizes the stack's **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** principle to navigate through the maze and find the exit.

## Project Features
- Implemented using the **Stack data structure** to track the player's movements within the maze.  
- The maze is represented as a **2D grid**, and the game logic handles navigation, backtracking, and finding the optimal path to escape.  
- Written entirely in **C++** with clean and modular code for easier understanding and further development.

## Project Purpose
This project was developed to:  
- Enhance understanding of **data structures (Stack)**.  
- Apply theoretical knowledge to a **real-world problem**.  
- Improve **problem-solving skills** and practice **efficient coding** in C++.
