Maze Escape Game
This project is a Maze Escape Game designed using the stack data structure in C++. The game utilizes the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle to navigate through the maze and find the exit.

Project Features
Implemented using the Stack data structure to track the player's movements within the maze.
The maze is represented as a 2D grid, and the game logic handles navigation, backtracking, and finding the optimal path to escape.
Written entirely in C++ with clean and modular code for easier understanding and further development.
Project Purpose
This project was developed to enhance my understanding of data structures, especially stacks, and apply them to a real-world problem. It also helped me improve my problem-solving skills and learn efficient coding practices in C++.
